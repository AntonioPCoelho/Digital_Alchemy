# Image Mixer - Digital Alchemy

## Overview

This repository contains the first assignment for the low-level programming discipline. The goal of this project is to mix two images and transform them into one through a process we call "digital alchemy."

## Project Description

In this assignment, you'll take two input images and combine them to create a single output image. This process involves manipulating the pixel data of the images at a low level, showcasing the power of digital image processing techniques.

## Features

- Combine two images into one
- Manipulate pixel data directly
- Explore low-level programming concepts
